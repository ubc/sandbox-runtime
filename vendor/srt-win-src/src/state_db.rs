//! Cross-broker state DB for `srt-win acl` — refcount stamped paths
//! and store original SDs so the LAST broker to release a path can
//! restore it.
//!
//! Lives at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\sandbox-runtime\state.db` (rusqlite,
//! WAL). The directory is ACL-stamped broker-only `(OI)(CI)` on
//! every open so the sandbox child cannot tamper with the
//! refcount or wipe snapshot rows.
//!
//! ## Disk-is-truth invariant
//!
//! A row is a **restore record** (`original_sd`, `file_id`) +
//! enumeration index + refcount edge. It NEVER asserts on-disk
//! state. A path counts as protected iff [`Locked::ensure_stamped`]
//! has, in this process under the init-mutex, READ the live DACL
//! and converged it to the broker allow-list. Every row primitive
//! that records "this file is stamped" is therefore module-private
//! — the only way for `main.rs` to assert protection is to receive
//! a sealed [`StampWitness`] from `ensure_stamped`.
//!
//! The restore record's INTEGRITY is anchored on disk via the
//! hash-ACE marker (see `acl.rs`): the broker stamp DACL carries
//! one `S-1-0-…` deny-`READ_CONTROL` ACE encoding
//! `SHA-256(original_sd || file_id)`, which the child cannot forge
//! or strip (no `WRITE_DAC`). Restore recomputes the hash from the
//! row and refuses to write back an `original_sd` that does not
//! match the on-disk marker. A poisoned DB row therefore degrades
//! to a loud fail-closed (`original_sd_tampered`), never to
//! attacker-chosen permissions.
//!
//! ## Locking and crash safety
//!
//! Every `acl stamp|restore|recover` runs under a single named
//! mutex `Local\sandbox-runtime-acl-init` (broker-only DACL). The
//! mutex — NOT a DB transaction — serializes whole operations
//! across brokers; `WAIT_ABANDONED` tells us the previous holder
//! died mid-op (crash-recovery already runs unconditionally).
//!
//! There is deliberately NO single enclosing transaction. Each
//! path's (FS mutation + row change) commits independently so a
//! failure on path Y can't revert path X. The one ordering rule is
//! "the row that preserves `original_sd` outlives the FS mutation":
//! upsert FIRST, then `SetNamedSecurityInfoW`. A crash between
//! leaves a row whose file is still `Unstamped`
//! ([`acl::classify_sd`]), so the next `ensure_stamped` re-derives
//! `original_sd = cur` and the upsert overwrites correctly.
