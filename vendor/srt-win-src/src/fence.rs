//! Per-exec delete/rename fence — **fallback** for ACL-stamped
//! files whose parent directory could not be stamped.
//!
//! Delete/rename is authorized by the PARENT directory's
//! `FILE_DELETE_CHILD`, which a file's broker-only DACL does not
//! touch. The PRIMARY protection is `acl stamp`'s parent-directory
//! allow-list (user gets Modify-without-`FILE_DELETE_CHILD`; see
//! [`crate::acl::apply_parent_allow_list`]) — that protection is
//! on-disk and survives across exec boundaries and process
//! teardown.
//!
//! When the parent can't be stamped (no `WRITE_DAC` on it, or the
//! file is at a volume root), the snapshot is marked
//! `parent_stamp_failed` and `srt-win exec --holder-pid` falls
//! back to this module: it opens each such path with
//! `FILE_SHARE_READ|FILE_SHARE_WRITE` (no `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`) and
//! holds the handle until the child exits — the OS refuses
//! delete/rename of those files (sharing violation). Multi-broker
//! handles coexist (each opens with R|W sharing); the child
//! cannot pre-fence (the file's DACL denies its open).
//!
//! For the fallback set the fence is **load-bearing**: a path
//! that exists but cannot be fenced means the deny guarantee is
//! incomplete, so [`open_delete_fence`] retries transient
//! share-mode conflicts and
//! then **fails** the exec rather than running the child with a
//! partial fence. A path that no longer exists is skipped — the
//! sandbox protects files present at initialization time, so a
//! file deleted from outside the sandbox after initialization is
//! no longer in scope.
