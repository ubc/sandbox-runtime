//! `srt-win` — CLI for the sandbox-runtime Windows network fence.
//!
//! Subcommands:
//!   install | uninstall                — convenience: group + WFP in one
//!                                         elevated call (one UAC prompt)
//!   group  create | status | delete    — manage the discriminator local group
//!   wfp    install | status | uninstall — manage the persistent WFP filters
//!   exec   -- <target> [args...]       — spawn under the deny-only-group
//!                                         token + job + hardening stack
//!   acl    stamp | restore | recover   — file-level denyRead/denyWrite via
//!                                         broker-only DACL stamp + state DB
//!
//! `status` subcommands write one line of JSON to stdout and exit 0.
//! Mutating subcommands require elevation and write human-readable
//! progress to stderr. `exec` propagates the child's exit code.

/// The dir fence is best-effort: a no-`FILE_SHARE_DELETE` handle
/// blocks the child renaming the parent dir ITSELF (rename is

/// don't stamp) — preventing path substitution of the directory
/// while the child runs. The state-DB dir is fenced for the same
/// reason (a child renaming it could plant a poisoned DB at the
/// path). Open-fail → log + continue: file DACLs still hold; only
/// directory-rename is unguarded (the documented residual).
///
/// Shared by the session-level (`--holder-pid`) and per-exec
/// (`--deny-*`) fence sites so the recipe for "what gets fenced"
