 * denials, so this function intersects each path against the configured
 * allow/deny set before forwarding it as a violation.
 *
 * The reported path is read out of the (untrusted) sandboxed process's memory
 * with process_vm_readv and is therefore ATTACKER-CONTROLLED and racy. bwrap's
 * mount table is the only enforcement boundary; the violation events emitted
 * here are diagnostic hints and must never gate a policy decision.
 *
 * The transport is a *filesystem* unix socket because bwrap runs with
 * `--unshare-net` (abstract sockets are net-namespace-scoped) and bwrap closes
 * inherited fds. Filesystem sockets survive across net + user + mount
 * namespaces as long as the path is bind-mounted into the sandbox.
