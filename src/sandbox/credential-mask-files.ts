/**
 * Credential file masking (Linux).
 *
 * For a `credentials.files` entry with `mode: "mask"`, srt reads the real
 * file content on the host, registers one or more sentinels in the
 * {@link SentinelRegistry}, and writes a fake file (sentinel-substituted)
 * to a manager-owned temp directory. The Linux sandbox then `--ro-bind`s
 * the fake over the real path, so the sandboxed process reads the
 * sentinel(s). The proxy substitution from env-var masking already scans
 * every header for any registered sentinel, so a tool that does
 * `Authorization: Bearer $(cat <maskedFile>)` reaches the upstream with
 * the real bytes — no proxy changes required.
 *
 * Without `extract`, masking is **whole-file**: one sentinel replaces the
 * entire content. With `extract`, masking is **structured**: a regex picks
 * out the credential value(s) and only those spans are replaced, so a tool
 * that parses the file (JSON/YAML/.netrc) still sees valid syntax. See
 * {@link extractAndSubstitute} and {@link CredentialFileConfigSchema}.
 *
 * On macOS, SBPL cannot redirect reads, so masked files degrade to
 * `mode: "deny"` (see macos-sandbox-utils.ts).
