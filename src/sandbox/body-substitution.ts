/**
 * Streaming sentinel→real substitution for forwarded HTTP request bodies.
 *
 * The proxy substitutes masked-credential sentinels in request headers
 * (SentinelRegistry.substituteInHeaders); a credential a tool places in a
 * request body (JSON payload, form post) would otherwise reach the API as
 * the useless fake. Sentinels are exact-match strings over `[a-z0-9_-]`, so
 * they survive JSON, form-urlencoded, multipart, and XML verbatim — a raw
 * byte scan needs no format parsing. Bodies are never buffered whole:
 * memory is bounded by one chunk plus a hold-back of `maxSentinelLength - 1`
 * bytes carried across chunk boundaries.
 *
 * Fail-safe direction: substitution is fake→real, so a missed sentinel
 * (compressed body, base64-wrapped, split by an encoder) means the FAKE
 * value reaches the API and auth fails — never a leaked secret.
